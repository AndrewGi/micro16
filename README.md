# micro16
Î¼16 is a variable sized CPU emulator to be used in future projects (targeting RISC-V for now)

I started trying to develop my own ISA (Instruction Set Architecture) in order to implement a microcontroller software platform for future projects. Very quickly I realized why ISAs cost so much to develop and license so I switch to RISC-V. Personally I have just started learning about it as of 6/19/2019 so development will be slow.

The aim of this project is not to out perform other project (ex: QEMU) but for me to learn rust and about system architectures. As this is a rust project, memory and program safety is important. Any input or help is welcome!

Architectures:
* Finished:
  - None! :)
* In Progress:
  - RISC-V
* Maybe?:
  - Arm
  - x86
  - xtensa
  - MIPS
